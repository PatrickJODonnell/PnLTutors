The files within this repository contain the files responsible for running and displaying the website for P&L Tutors, a tutoring company for all subjects for kids in K-12. This project is an ongoing process that will continue to be improved upon as the company grows. For now, the business need is simply a landing site with an operational contact page that will email our tutors the messages sent my potential customers.

This website was developed by myself (Patrick O'Donnell) as a way to both build my web development portfolio and to increase the business opportunities of P&L Tutors. This is my first web-development project in a series of many.
